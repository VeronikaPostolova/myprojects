Task5
We should design a multilingual dictionary. We have a set of words in the dictionary.
Each word can be in some language and can have synonyms and explanations in the 
same language and translation words and explanations in several other languages.
The synonyms and translation words are sets of words from the dictionary. 
The explanations are textual descriptions.
Design a database schema (a set of tables and relationships) to store the dictionary.

Task 6
Add support in the previous database for storing antonym pairs.
Add support for storing part-of-speech information (e.g. verb, noun, adjective, …).
Add support for storing hypernym / hyponym chains (e.g. tree ? oak, pine, walnut-tree, …).
