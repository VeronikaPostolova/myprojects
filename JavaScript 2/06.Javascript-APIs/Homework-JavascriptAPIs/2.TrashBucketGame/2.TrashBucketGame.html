        1. When the user cleans all the trash, he is asked for a nickname and his score is saved in the local storage
        The score of the user is the time that took him to clean the trash
        2. Implement a high-score board, that is visible on page load and shows the top 5 scores 
        The 5 users that cleaned the trash fastest -->
